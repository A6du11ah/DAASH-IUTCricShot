<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



Welcome to our project for detecting cricket shot types from video footage using machine learning! This project aims to classify cricket shots in real-time, leveraging advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques.



### Key Features

* **Advanced Object Detection with YOLO v9:** Utilizes a custom-trained YOLO v9 model to locate and crop the batsman from the video frames.
* **LRCN for Shot Type Classification:** Employs a Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) to analyze the cropped video sequence and classify the shot type.

### Methodology

* **Object Detection:**
    * YOLO v9 is used to detect the batsman in each frame.
    * The detected region around the batsman is cropped for further analysis.
* **Shot Classification:**
    * The cropped video sequence is processed by an LRCN model.
    * The LRCN model classifies the type of cricket shot based on the batsmanâ€™s movements.
